    "Had the Roman Empire never fallen, today we might be using Roman numerals instead of the familiar Arabic ones (0..9).  Naturally, there would be a great demand for Roman-Numeral-based calculators.  This assignment is to design and implement object-oriented software for such a calculator.  The calculator must be able to perform multiplication, division, modulus, addition, and subtraction operations on “roman number” operands, where a roman number is a valid sequence of Roman Numerals.  Make sure you follow all the directions below, explicitly."

    "* Don't subtract a letter from another letter more than ten times greater. This means that you can only subtract __I__ from __V__ or __X__, and __X__ from __L__ or __C__, so for example __1999__ is __MCMXCIX__, and not __MIM__.\n",
